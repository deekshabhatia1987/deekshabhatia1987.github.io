# Blog Images

Place your blog post images in this directory.

## Image Guidelines

- **Dimensions**: Recommended 800x600px or similar aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File size**: Optimize images to under 200KB for fast loading
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `blog-1.jpg`, `post-nature-walk.jpg`, etc.

## Required Images

For the current blog structure, you'll need:
- `blog-1.jpg` - Featured image for first blog post
- `blog-2.jpg` - Featured image for second blog post
- `blog-3.jpg` - Featured image for third blog post
- Additional images for archive posts as needed

Each blog card and individual blog post uses these images, so make sure they're visually appealing and relevant to your content.
